## 🎮 About the Project
Scrabble is a classic word-building game where players create words on a board to earn points.  
Our team — **CMDevs** — decided to recreate the core mechanics of Scrabble using **pure C++** with fully **console-based output**.

This project was developed as a part of our school programming initiative to improve our understanding of:
- data structures  
- word validation algorithms  
- console UI mechanics  
- teamwork & collaborative software development

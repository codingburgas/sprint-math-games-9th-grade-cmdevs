## About the Project
Scrabble is a classic word-building game where players create words on a board to earn points.  
Our team — **CMDevs** — decided to recreate the core mechanics of Scrabble using **pure C++** with a fully-fledged **console interface**.  
  
This project was developed as a part of our school programming initiative to improve our understanding of:
- C++ software and game development
- console UI mechanics
- teamwork
